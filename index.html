            <p>Timisoara was a very welcome surprise to us, with calm and clean streets and amazing Art Nouveau buildings in the beautiful main square and old center. We were there <span class="cite-dots">... </span><a href="#" class="cite-trigger">read more</a><span class="cite-more">right before Christmas, so we were able to experience the extra charm given by the snow and Christmas atmosphere! At the same time we weren't able to enjoy the famous city parks, so we'll have to go back in another season for that!</span></p>

            <p>Traveling is a great way to expand your horizon. It's a lot of fun and teaches you wonderful things about you and the world. But the best way to travel is <span class="cite-dots">... </span><a href="#" class="cite-trigger">read more</a><span class="cite-more"> together with wonderful people. And the greatest people to meet when you travel are the locals.<br>
                This is something that gets away when you go to the big cities. That's why I prefer to go to smaller ones, people are friendlier there.<br>
                That's what I can say about Timisoara. It has been my home for 13 years and it's still my favourite place to return. There's enough going on to be interesting and not too much to get tiresome. People are friendly and open. It's a beautiful city and we get 8 months of sunshine a year.</span></p>

            <p>Before I came to Timisoara, I've heard many different names for this city. The City of Flowers, Little Wien or The City of Parks, all descriptions of something which for me, a fresh high school graduate looking for <span class="cite-dots">... </span><a href="#" class="cite-trigger">read more</a><span class="cite-more">a city to spend the next 3 years in college, seemed something unreal. There's no way people can fall in love with a city'', was my ironic and naive reply to everyone speaking with such enthusiasm about Timisoara.
                Timisoara gave me friends, gave me access to a lot of great things and experiences, gave me the best 3 years in my life. In return, I give it my admiration, my appreciation and my endless love. when you are together with wonderful people. And the greatest people to meet when you travel are the locals.<br>

            <p>There was a friendly vibe as you entered the Banat Village Museum: fresh aer, people buzzing around, the smell of steaming pastries and traditional Romanian food, ambient music. The whole place was breathing music, art, tradition and culture.</p>

            <p>Traveling is one of my favorite things, so having friends in different parts of the country

                you could say is a great advantage. But through all the places I wondered, one has

                remained very dear to my heart: Timisoara.<span class="cite-dots">.. </span><a href="#" class="cite-trigger">read more</a><span class="cite-more">A beautiful combination of classic and

                modern, great views that leave you breathless and a place where you can create beautiful

                memories that will probably last you a lifetime. <br>As a tourist you get to experience the

                best parts of a location without the downside of the routine that kicks in after living there

                for a while, and Timisoara has a lot of “nice and exciting” to offer! <br>The pubs, bars and

                night life can keep you up and dancing all night long, and the people!! Ohh, don’t get me

                started on the mosaic of personalities and styles that surround you. It is a city of contrast,

                beautiful contrast between classic, art and intellectuality perfectly combined with the

                modernism of technology. <br>If you don’t believe me, go see for yourselves. You will not be

                disappointed.</span></p>
